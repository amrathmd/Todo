# Solving the problem

A todo App used to markdown all the tasks to be accomplished on the particular day designed using react.

React basic hooks such as States,Effects,Props is used for saving states and passing different static and dynamic functionalities.

The difficulty was to store all those states then i have gone through concept of localStorage on the browser where the given data can be converted into JSON file and can be retrieved from there.localStorage is used to store the new entered todo List and store its value

Wondering how to store the typed notes then a built in hook called as "React markdown editor" helped in creating writing and previewing the entered data and given an UI.React Mde is copied directly from react documentation.

Spliting the components was done using React-split hook which made the task easy.

Features: 

1.New notes can be created and can be stored in browser itself.

2.Deleting the created todo can also be done.

3.Updation of notes can be made and saved.

4.Finished notes can be marked in the body of todo as Finished.

5.writing and previewing can be done in two different Tabs.
